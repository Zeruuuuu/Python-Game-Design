# Python-Game-Design
### In this project I designed a game using python. I've constructed a character, and let it move on the game panel. The scoring system is real-time and there are some special rules on the panel, like the tensors, when passing the tensors there will be punishment. etc
### This game design aimed to built me a strong fundation in python, standard library, and coding ability
